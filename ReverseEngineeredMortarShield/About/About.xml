	<description>With all the mechanoid clusters that have been landing on the rimworlds as of late, it was only a matter of time before some bright spark conceived a way to use their technology for the betterment of colonists everywhere. The results are mortar and bullet shields which don't protect as large of an area, take a while to recharge and require a fair chunk of power and are expensive to build, but still have the potential to help a colony hold out against a siege or raid for longer than they might have done without them.</description>

Version 1.6.40 (May 2nd 2020)

* Updated both shields with new textures, which I acquired from an 'unknown alien' (seriously, that's how they wanted to be credited).

Version 1.4.40 (April 29th 2020)

* At the request of the game's developers, owning the Royalty DLC is once again required in order to use this mod.

Version 1.3.40 (April 25th 2020)

* Changed name of research tab to 'Mech Tech' (was 'Mortar Shield').
* Fixed shield recharge times going into negative values.
	* Author Note: Many thanks to Fluffy from the RimWorld Discord for helping to fix this issue.
* Increased techprint market value to 3000 (was 2500).
* Lowered mass of uninstalled shields to 30 (was 75).
* Changed work value of building both shields to 300 (was 750).
	* Author Note: Actually, it was 13; I didn't realise that the work value specified in the XML file is then divided by 60 to get the in-game value.
* Made a slight adjustment to the texture of both shields.
	* Author Note: I know I could have carried on using the existing texture, but I wanted to use my own. As you'll see, it's not a good edit; if you can anything better, please let me know!

Version 1.3.30 (April 23rd 2020)

* Both shields can now be uninstalled and reinstalled.
	* Author Note: This change means that players have greater flexibility in where they can put the shields; it also means they no longer have to deconstruct them when they are not needed.
* Both shields now show a tooltip showing the building's health when hovered over with the mouse cursor.
* Increased HP of both shields back to 150.
* Both shields now require 750 work to build (was 1000).
* Both shields now have a mass of 75kg (was 0).
	* Author Note: I had to give them a mass when I allowed them to be uninstallable; they can still not be sold to, or purchased from, any traders.

Version 1.2.20 (April 20th 2020)

- Both shields no longer leave behind resources when destroyed.
	- Author Note: My own testing showed that these structures left behind a sizeable amount of resources and slag chunks when destroyed.
	- This change makes it harder for players to reconstruct them, and forces them to manage their resources more efficiently.
- Both shields now have 100HP each (was 150).
	- Author Note: This change means that players will have to rethink their defensive strategy, as any opportunistic melee attacker can easily make short work of it out in the open.
- Both shields now require 1000W of power each (was 500W for the bullet shield and 750W for the mortar shield).
	- Author Note: Increasing the power requirement means that players won't be able to construct as many of these buildings as they could before.
	- They will have to choose between extending their power grid, thus meaning they'll have more areas to protect, or sacrificing some areas to defend others.
- Both shields now require 50 Uranium for construction.
	- Author Note: Requiring Uranium for construction means that players will have to wait a while before they can start building these structures.
- Both shields now require a pawn with a Construction skill of at least 10 (was 8).
	- Author Note: This is advanced technology, after all; it makes sense to increase the skill required to build it.
- Both shields no longer reduce beauty in the area where they are constructed.
	- Author Note: Given what they do, I think colonists would say they are wonderful things, and therefore not ugly at all.

Version 1.2.8 (April 19th 2020)

- Increased tech level of research to Spacer (was Industrial).
- Increased cost of research to 4800 (was 3600).
- Changed name of research to 'mechanoid shield tech.'
- Changed description of mortar shield.
- Changed description of bullet shield.
- Research now requires 2 techprints, which can be obtained (rarely) from the imperial faction.

Version 1.1.3 (April 19th 2020)

- Added bullet shield
	- Protection radius: 5
	- Required materials: 600 steel, 100 plasteel and 2 advanced components
	- Power usage: 500W
- Reduced protection radius of the mortar shield to 10 (was 15).
- Changed mod name; you may have to re-enable it as a result.

Version 1.0.1 (April 19th 2020)

- Initial Release.
