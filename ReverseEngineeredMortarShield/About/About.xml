	<description>With all the mechanoid clusters that have been landing on the rimworlds as of late, it was only a matter of time before some bright spark conceived a way to use their technology for the betterment of colonists everywhere. With the right technology, colonists can now build their own mortar and bullet shields - which do the same job as their mechanoid counterparts - to help defend themselves against all but the most determined of attackers.</description>
