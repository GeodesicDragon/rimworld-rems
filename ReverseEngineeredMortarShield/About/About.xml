	<description>With all the mechanoid clusters that have been landing on the rimworlds as of late, it was only a matter of time before some bright spark conceived a way to use their technology for the betterment of colonists everywhere. The results are mortar and bullet shields which don't protect as large of an area, take a while to recharge, require a fair chunk of power and are expensive to build, but still have the potential to help a colony hold out against a siege or raid for longer than they might have done without them.</description>
