	* Require research before they can be built; you will need to research shields first and also acquire 2 techprints.
	* Require 1000 steel, 500 plasteel, 300 uranium, 10 advanced components, and a reinforced barrel to build.
	* When destroyed, leaves behind 10% of the materials used to build it (minus the barrel).
	* Market value of 15000 silver.
	* Requires 2000W of power.
	* Can be moved once built.
	* Can be turned on and off.

* XML Extensions: Replaced the textbox for changing how many techprints the research needs with a slider.

Version 2.10.18 (April 22nd 2022)

* Re-added support for RimWorld 1.1, because I'm an idiot who thought that Royalty = RimWorld 1.2.

Version 2.10.17 (March 31st 2022)

Version 2.2.12 (August 21st 2021)

* Are your bullet and mortar shields putting a huge strain on your power grid? Well, now you can change that... literally!
	* You can now change how much power each shield consumes by going to Mod Settings > More Mod Settings > REMS.
	* You will need to restart the game when you change a setting.
	* This feature is possible thanks to the XML Extended mod by Imranfish (which is now required in order to use REMS).
	* REMS must be loaded after XML Extended.
	* I may add more configuration options in future, such as changing the protection radius or required materials.

Version 2.0.12 (July 26th 2021)

	* Only outlander and imperial factions will send them.
	* If you have the MSF and/or UAC faction mods installed, they will also send them. At least this way you get a bit more variety.
		* I wanted to add the mod to factions that would have the tech level needed to build these; these two both have big R&D teams, so it stands to reason they'd have access to the technology.
	* Also, you are now able to request them via the comms console.

Version 2.0.1 (July 11th 2021)

* Mod is now compatible with the RimWorld 1.3 patch.

Version 2.0.0 (January 24th 2021)

A lot has changed in the months that have passed since the first mech clusters touched down on the rimworlds.

First of all, with so many people using the tech to defend themselves against the mechanoids (and each other), it was only a matter of time before traders decided to get in on the action. As a result, numerous caravans and orbital traders have begun offering either the basic materials required to build shields, or completed units which only need to be installed. Secondly, human understanding of the tech has finally reached the point where constructed shields are now on par with their mechanoid counterparts.

* Increased mortar shield protection radius to 25 (was 10).
* Increased bullet shield protection radius to 20 (was 8).
* Researching the shields now requires 3 techprints (was 2).
* Increased the steel cost of building a bullet shield to 600 (was 450).
* Increased the plasteel cost of building a bullet shield to 150 (was 100).
* Increased the uranium cost of building a bullet shield to 200 (was 100).
* Increased the uranium cost of building a mortar shield to 200 (was 100).
* Increased the advanced cost of building a bullet shield to 5 (was 3).
* Increased the advanced cost of building a mortar shield to 5 (was 4).
* Increased power usage of mortar shields to 1200W (was 800W).
* Increased power usage of mortar shields to 1000W (was 800W).
* Increased charge duration of mortar shields to 60000 ticks (was 43200).
* Increased charge duration of bullet shields to 60000 ticks (was 43200).
* Increased hitpoints of mortar shields to 200 (was 150).
* Increased hitpoints of bullet shields to 200 (was 150).
* Bullet and mortar shields can now be traded.
* Added a trader who will buy and sell both varieties of shield.
	* The trader also carries the quantities of steel, plasteel, uranium and advanced components needed to build shields.
	* The price of materials at this trader will fluctuate, up to a maximum of 100% of the item's market value (50% for advanced components).
	* The trader also carries 20000 silver.
* Set market value of bullet shield to 15000 silver (was 7500).
* Set market value of mortar shield to 10000 silver (was 5000).

Version 1.8.58 (August 26th 2020)

* Mod is now compatible with the RimWorld 1.2 update.
* Increased the cost of researching the technology to 7200 (was 4800).
* Reduced the steel cost of the bullet shield to 450 (was 600).
* Reduced the steel cost of the mortar shield to 600 (was 800).
* A broadshield core is now required to build a bullet shield.
* A broadshield core is now required to build a mortar shield.

AUTHOR NOTE: Requiring a broadshield core adds a bit more realism to the mod; you get the cores from mechanoid shields, so it stands to reason you'd use them to build your own. This will, of course, restrict how many shields you can actually build, unless you get a lot of mech clusters, though there are mods which let you craft your own broadshield cores.

Version 1.8.52 (May 13th 2020)

* Increased bullet shield protection radius to 8 (was 5).
* Reduced work amount of building both shields to 240 (was 300).
* Reduced power usage of both shields to 800W (was 1000W).
* Reduced recharge time of both shields to 17 hours (was 1 day).
* Increased uranium requirement for building both shields to 100 (was 50).
* Increased advanced component requirement for building bullet shields to 3 (was 2).
* Increased advanced component requirement for building mortar shields to 4 (was 3).

Version 1.8.41 (May 7th 2020)

* Updated French translation, courtesy of yaannaa.

Version 1.8.40 (May 7th 2020)

Version 1.6.40 (May 2nd 2020)

* Updated both shields with new textures, which I acquired from an 'unknown alien' (seriously, that's how they wanted to be credited).

Version 1.4.40 (April 29th 2020)

* At the request of the game's developers, owning the Royalty DLC is once again required in order to use this mod.

Version 1.3.40 (April 25th 2020)

* Changed name of research tab to 'Mech Tech' (was 'Mortar Shield').
* Fixed shield recharge times going into negative values.
	* Author Note: Many thanks to Fluffy from the RimWorld Discord for helping to fix this issue.
* Increased techprint market value to 3000 (was 2500).
* Lowered mass of uninstalled shields to 30 (was 75).
* Changed work value of building both shields to 300 (was 750).
	* Author Note: Actually, it was 13; I didn't realise that the work value specified in the XML file is then divided by 60 to get the in-game value.
* Made a slight adjustment to the texture of both shields.
	* Author Note: I know I could have carried on using the existing texture, but I wanted to use my own. As you'll see, it's not a good edit; if you can provide anything better, please let me know!

Version 1.3.30 (April 23rd 2020)

* Both shields can now be uninstalled and reinstalled.
	* Author Note: This change means that players have greater flexibility in where they can put the shields; it also means they no longer have to deconstruct them when they are not needed.
* Both shields now show a tooltip showing the building's health when hovered over with the mouse cursor.
* Increased HP of both shields back to 150.
* Both shields now require 750 work to build (was 1000).
* Both shields now have a mass of 75kg (was 0).
	* Author Note: I had to give them a mass when I allowed them to be uninstallable; they can still not be sold to, or purchased from, any traders.

Version 1.2.20 (April 20th 2020)

- Both shields no longer leave behind resources when destroyed.
	- Author Note: My own testing showed that these structures left behind a sizeable amount of resources and slag chunks when destroyed.
	- This change makes it harder for players to reconstruct them, and forces them to manage their resources more efficiently.
- Both shields now have 100HP each (was 150).
	- Author Note: This change means that players will have to rethink their defensive strategy, as any opportunistic melee attacker can easily make short work of it out in the open.
- Both shields now require 1000W of power each (was 500W for the bullet shield and 750W for the mortar shield).
	- Author Note: Increasing the power requirement means that players won't be able to construct as many of these buildings as they could before.
	- They will have to choose between extending their power grid, thus meaning they'll have more areas to protect, or sacrificing some areas to defend others.
- Both shields now require 50 Uranium for construction.
	- Author Note: Requiring Uranium for construction means that players will have to wait a while before they can start building these structures.
- Both shields now require a pawn with a Construction skill of at least 10 (was 8).
	- Author Note: This is advanced technology, after all; it makes sense to increase the skill required to build it.
- Both shields no longer reduce beauty in the area where they are constructed.
	- Author Note: Given what they do, I think colonists would say they are wonderful things, and therefore not ugly at all.

Version 1.2.8 (April 19th 2020)

- Increased tech level of research to Spacer (was Industrial).
- Increased cost of research to 4800 (was 3600).
- Changed name of research to 'mechanoid shield tech.'
- Changed description of mortar shield.
- Changed description of bullet shield.
- Research now requires 2 techprints, which can be obtained (rarely) from the imperial faction.

Version 1.1.3 (April 19th 2020)

- Added bullet shield
	- Protection radius: 5
	- Required materials: 600 steel, 100 plasteel and 2 advanced components
	- Power usage: 500W
- Reduced protection radius of the mortar shield to 10 (was 15).
- Changed mod name; you may have to re-enable it as a result.

Version 1.0.1 (April 19th 2020)

- Initial Release.
